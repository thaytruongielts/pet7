      'Have you ever tried playing the kind of video games that your parents played? The Museum of Science in Manchester, in the UK, has held an exhibition for the last few years, which invites visitors to do exactly that. It offers them the chance to play games from the last 40 years, in various sessions throughout the day.',
      'These video games sessions have now become one of the main attractions of the museum. They are full of people every day, playing a wide range of games.',
      '__GAP_1__ For parents, for example, these are usually the games they used to play in their childhood.',
      'There’s also an educational purpose to the games. For instance, some old types of computer, dating back 40 years, are also available in the sessions. They were originally used in classrooms to teach pupils to write their own computer programs.',
      '__GAP_2__ Now, the museum is holding workshops that encourage children to learn similar skills – and they’re still very popular.',
      'The sessions are also seen as social events, as people discover how much fun it is to play video games with other family members. And there’s also an area at Power Up! where a number of visitors can sit down together. __GAP_3__ And nowadays, this is often how fans of video games are more likely to experience playing.',
      'The exhibition also shows how much progress technology has made over the last 40 years. Parents can often remember playing very simple games. But the games that are played today are more complex. __GAP_4__ And the players also have to use much more complicated techniques.',
      'However, one serious side of the exhibition is that organisers also want to show that video gaming is an important industry, employing many skilled people.',
      '__GAP_5__ That way, people who enjoy gaming will also understand all the hard work, talent and imagination that goes into creating these amazing games.'

        'When the Mona Lisa was stolen from the Louvre in Paris in 1911 it caused a sensation and left the art world and police puzzled as to how it had been taken and who had carried out the crime. It also helped make the work of art probably the most famous painting in the world.',

        'Peruggia kept the painting for two years in his Paris apartment before eventually contacting an Italian art dealer, offering to return the painting to Florence for a reward. __GAP_3__ He argued he was returning the painting to its rightful home.',
        'He was finally arrested after passing the painting to the dealer. However, many Italians saw his actions as those of a national hero. __GAP_4__ The painting was indeed shown off around Italy before it was eventually returned to Paris and the Louvre.',
